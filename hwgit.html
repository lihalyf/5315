      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System, which could be used to store contents, maintain the history of change and present the full copy of code to all the developers instead of only central server. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need.<p> 

      <p>We need source code Version Control System because of the following 3 reasons. At first, there are generally multiple developers working together in the real-life projects. The version control system is needs to ensure no code conflicts among the developers when they work on the same project. Secondly, the requirement of projects may change frequently. Therefore, the version control system would allow developers to track back the older version of code and backup if necessary.  Finally, branching in Git is critical for the projects running in parallel with the same codebase.<p>

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Repository is a data structure which Git stores that information in. Local repo is the repository in the user's local personal computer and user could work and store the code offline to local repo. A remote repo in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. When multiple developers use Git in team project, each developer is able to pull or clone all the contents from remote repository. Once a developer has finished his part, he could add the changes of files and commit it to his local repository offline. Then when he gets access to Internet, he could push his updates from local repository to the remote repository. It is the same working steps for all the other developer to work on the same project at the same time.<p>
